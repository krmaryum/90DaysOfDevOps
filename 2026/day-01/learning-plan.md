# 90-Day DevOps & Cloud Learning Plan

## What is my understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?

DevOps is a **culture and mindset** that focuses on strong collaboration between **Development and Operations teams**.  
The main goal of DevOps is to:

- Reduce time to market  
- Automate repetitive and manual tasks  
- Improve reliability and scalability of applications  
- Deliver software faster and more efficiently to end users  

Cloud Engineering provides the **infrastructure and services** needed to build, deploy, and scale applications without managing physical hardware. Cloud platforms help teams deploy applications globally, securely, and cost-effectively.

Together, DevOps and Cloud Engineering enable **continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), automation, and scalability**.

## Why am I starting to learn DevOps & Cloud?

I am starting to learn DevOps and Cloud because:

- DevOps is **still in high demand** in the IT industry  
- Most modern companies use **cloud platforms and DevOps practices**  
- It offers strong **career growth and job opportunities**  
- I want to build practical, real-world skills  
- My goal is to **get a job as a DevOps/Cloud Engineer**

## Where do I want to reach?

My goal is to grow from **Zero to Hero** in DevOps and Cloud Engineering.

Specifically, I want to:

- Build a strong foundation in Linux, networking, and cloud concepts  
- Learn tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and cloud services  
- Gain hands-on experience through labs and projects  
- Become job-ready within 90 days  
- Start my career as a **DevOps Engineer**

## How will I stay consistent every single day?

To stay consistent, I will:

- Study **4 hours every day** without fail  
- Practice hands-on labs and assignments daily  
- Revise what I learned at the end of each day  
- Help my classmates whenever possible to strengthen my understanding  
- Stay disciplined and trust the 90-day learning process  

Consistency, practice, and discipline will be my keys to success.

**This 90-day plan is my career execution blueprint.**
